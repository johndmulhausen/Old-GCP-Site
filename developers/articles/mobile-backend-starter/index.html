  <h4>A Scalable and Highly Available Mobile Backend&mdash;Without Writing Server-side Code</h4>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The tremendous growth and proliferation of mobile devices is leading to changes in the architecture of mobile applications. Developers increasingly move their user interface logic from the server-side to the client-side, delivering applications as native or HTML clients. These applications typically interact with backend servers using well-defined RESTful APIs provided by a server backend.</p>
  <p>As a result of this trend, many developers are beginning to see the advantages of a new breed of cloud services, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBaaS&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZPno6WsOrXn2BOhmlR5IpRRSyiw">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a>. These services facilitate the integration between their mobile clients and their backend services. Developers also find that BaaS reduces the effort required for developing backend servers. They want the ability to turn a brilliant idea for a mobile app into a simple proof of concept almost instantly.</p>
  <p>Many BaaS offerings, however, come with their own set of challenges, such as scalability, availability, and extensibility. If your application is a big success, for example, the BaaS offering must scale to respond to huge increases in traffic volume without any disruption to your regular services. You also want a system that makes it easy to extend the your application&rsquo;s capabilities. You may decide to add new functionality to address a critical bug in your application, for example, or enable features critical to your business&rsquo; growth. Many BaaS offerings are black boxes that restrict developers and do not allow them to solve these challenges.</p>

  <h3>Mobile Backend Starter</h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/samples/mbs/">Mobile Backend Starter</a> solution provides the benefits of BaaS, such as a single-click deployment of backend without server-side coding. It combines these benefits with the advantages of Platform as a Service (PaaS), such as high scalability, availability, and extensibility.</p>

  <p>Not technically a BaaS, Mobile Backend Starter is an application you deploy and run on <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> with a single click. App Engine is a complete development stack that uses familiar technologies to build and host applications on the same infrastructure used at Google. As with other BaaS offerings, Mobile Backend Starter provides powerful backend features that are instantly available to your mobile application. You do not need to write any server-side coding. Because Mobile Backend Starter is an application that runs on App Engine, you also gain the benefits of PaaS. These benefits include the virtually-unlimited scalability and high availability of App Engine. You can also use the server-side code of Mobile Backend Starter to extend its functionality as you like.</p>

  <p>Mobile Backend Starter comes with a number of functionalities. These functionalities include easy data store access, embedded user authentication and authorization, push notifications, and publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging. Using the client library, you can develop an Android/iOS app that integrates seamlessly and securely with the backend functionalities. A mobile application built using the Mobile Backend Starter consists of the following components. See Fig. 1 for how these components work together.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A Mobile Backend server application deployed on Google App Engine</li>
    <li>Android/iOS client libraries and APIs for accessing the Mobile Backend</li>
    <li>Android/iOS client application developed using the Mobile Backend client library</li>

  <h2>Key features</h2>
  <p>The following sections detail the features of the Mobile Backend Starter. You may also refer to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/samples/mbs/">Mobile Backend Starter Getting Started</a> document to learn how easy it is to deploy the backend.</p>

  <h3>Datastore access and authentication</h3>
  <p>The Cloud Backend API is included in the Mobile Backend Starter sample&rsquo;s Android/iOS client library. Developers can use the API to write application data to App Engine Datastore. The API handles several tasks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5>Authentication:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Lets users select a Google account for accessing the service when launched the first time</li>
        <li>Caching the selected account and reusing it</li>
        <li>Implementing a complex OAuth2 flow to manage access tokens and refresh tokens</li>
        <li>Writing server code to handle a request as a call from an authenticated user<br></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Authorization:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Authorizing access to each Datastore kind (table)</li>
        <li>Checking whether the requesting user has sufficient authority to read/write on the kind<br></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>JSON and REST:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Packing the parameters into a JSON doc at client and passing it to the server&rsquo;s REST API</li>
        <li>Receiving the JSON from client and dispatching the request based on the URI</li>
        <li>Executing query code, serializing the result into JSON, and sending it back to the client<br></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Asynchronous calls (Android only):</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Wrapping a <span class="code">Handler</span> class required by <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/processes-and-threads.html#Threads">The Android development guideline</a>, which requires developers writing dozens of lines of code and a detailed understanding of Android coding and threading practices</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Mobile Backend Starter condenses all the tasks above into just three lines of code. Developers can focus on expressing the essence of their application logic with Android/iOS code. They do not have to be concerned with writing the rest of the code.</p>
  <h3>Continuous query
  </h3>
  <p>When implementing a live and interactive UI application, developers must write many lines of code, which might include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="bld">Server-side code</span> for capturing all changes made by clients on different matching conditions, with the scalability to handle tens of thousands of subscriptions from online clients</li>
    <li><span class="bld">Google Cloud Messaging for Android or Apple Push Notification Service code</span> for push notifications,  ID management for each device, and integration with Task Queues for scalable fan-out of messages</li>
    <li><span class="bld">Client-side code</span> for receiving the push notification and re-executing the query, and calling back an appropriate handler to update the UI with a proper Activity instance and UI thread</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Mobile Backend Starter condenses all these development efforts into just one line of code. </p>
  <p>How does the process work? The Cloud Backend API provides a subset of the App Engine Datastore query API that includes logical and comparison operators. These operators can also be combined to express more complex and hierarchical query conditions.</p>
  <p>The API also supports a unique feature called continuous query, which is used in stream processing that applies queries to ever-changing data. The continuous query feature in the Cloud Backend API is useful for capturing any updates to data on the backend and for sharing the changes with all or selected online users instantly.</p>
  <p>Continuous query executes as a retrospective search on existing entities already stored in the App Engine Datastore. It also executes a prospective search on any updates/inserts to the App Engine Datastore in the future. You can use continuous query, for example, to update the UI on your Android/iOS app in real time, whenever the backend receives new updates from users that match the query condition. Behind the scenes, the Mobile Backend Starter enables continuous query in various ways: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>By a unification of App Engine Datastore Query for querying against past data</li>
    <li>Through the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/prospectivesearch/">Prospective Search API</a> for matching with future data</li>
    <li>
      With <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/">Google Cloud Messaging for Android</a> and Apple Push Notification Service for real-time push notification to mobile devices<br><br>
      <span class="ital">Note: Prospective Search API is an experimental feature of App Engine, so the continuous query is also experimental</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You may be familiar with the event-driven programming and data-binding against UI elements common in a modern web app development. Continuous query lets you create rich and interactive user experiences on mobile apps using fewer lines of code. Users no longer need to hit &ldquo;Reload&rdquo; buttons repeatedly, for instance. Nor does your app require a classic polling mechanism to fetch the latest updates.</p>
  <p>Continuous query greatly improves the user experience. It potentially reduces the costs of network access and CPU and power consumption incurred from either repeated reload button selections or continuous polling.</p>

  <h3>Publish/Subscribe messaging</h3>
  <p>The Mobile Backend Starter sample provides real-time <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPublish%25E2%2580%2593subscribe_pattern&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTwAle6JZUoq_1kdhwDO_6oceTWw">Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) messaging</a> across mobile devices. Pub/sub messaging is a software architectural pattern that lets developers implement message broadcasting between Publishers, or message senders, and Subscribers, or message receivers. In the Mobile Backend Starter sample, developers can define any number of Topic IDs to represent groups of clients interested in one topic.</p>
  <p>The push messages are persistent and offline-ready. If subscriber clients are offline and unable to receive real-time messages, they receive any unread messages once they come back online.</p>
  <p>The pub/sub messaging can be used in a variety of applications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1:1 real-time chats or emails among users</li>
    <li>Group chats or real-time bulletin board/blog/discussion forums</li>
    <li>Real-time, online, in-game communications</li>
    <li>Real-time streams of messages for each user&rsquo;s social networks, hashtags, and keywords</li>
    <li>Broadcasting and alerts on stock prices, news, keywords, and more</li>
    <li>P2P communications between clients&mdash;an Android/iOS app could act as a server for others</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This pub/sub messaging feature is built on the App Engine Prospective Search API. This configuration enables fast and scalable matching between massive numbers of online publishers and subscribers. As a result, a developer does not need to invest additional time and resources building a robust pub/sub messaging infrastructure to handle a large number of subscribers.</p>
