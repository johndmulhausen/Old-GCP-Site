  <h2>What you will learn</h2>
  <p>By going through this brief tutorial, you will learn how Google Cloud Storage can be used to easily add disaster recovery to your <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> installation by backing your data up into, and restoring it from, Google&rsquo;s cloud. Although this tutorial focuses on backing up and restoring Cassandra data in particular, the concepts can be applied broadly to any backup use case. This tutorial was developed and tested on Google Compute Engine virtual machines running Linux, however the information provided is applicable for any environment supported by the <a href="/storage/docs/gsutil_install#specifications">gsutil</a> tool.</p>

  <a name="requir"></a>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>To follow along with this tutorial you will need:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Access to data you would like to back up
      <ol style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>We will be referring to Cassandra 1.2.2 specific data in the tutorial.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Python 2.7 installed on the target system
      <ol style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Having the <a href="http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation">PyYaml</a> module installed is helpful</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Crontab (or some other similar cron job scheduler)</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="wywb"></a>
  <h2>What you will build</h2>
  <p>In this exercise, you will write two scripts. The first script automates the daily backup of your data to Google Cloud Storage. The second script recovers your data after disaster strikes. This tutorial also includes a small cron job that calls your backup script on a designated schedule.</p>

  <a name="ots"></a>
  <h2>Overview of the Steps</h2>
  <p>This tutorial assumes that you already have familiarity with Cassandra, and have access to the data files that Cassandra stores in its host&rsquo;s filesystem.</p>
  <p>Here are the high level steps that will be covered:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Choosing your disaster recovery strategy</li>
    <li>Getting setup to use Google Cloud Storage</li>
    <li>Writing a script (Python) to backup data to Google Cloud Storage</li>
    <li>Adding the script to a daily cron job</li>
    <li>Writing a script to recover data from Google Cloud Storage</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="dys"></a>
  <h2>Choosing Your Strategy</h2>
  <p>Cassandra has two built-in methods of backing up and restoring data: snapshots and incremental backups. Detailed information about these methods can be found in the <a href="http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.2/operations/backup_restore">documentation</a> on the DataStax&rsquo;s site. Both of these methods can be done without explicitly quiescing Cassandra, and both can be supplemented to provide increased security against catastrophic loss by moving the data into Google Cloud Storage.</p>
  <p>The strategy used in this tutorial will be to combine snapshots with daily backups to Google Cloud Storage.</p>

  <a name="gsgcs"></a>
  <h2>Getting Set Up with Google Cloud Storage</h2>
  <p>If you already have a Google Cloud Storage account and have installed <a href="/storage/docs/gsutil">gsutil</a>, you may skip to the next section.</p>
  <p><a href="/storage/">Google Cloud Storage</a> is a service within Google Cloud Platform. It allows developers to store application data directly to Google&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Google Cloud Storage can be activated via the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google APIs Console</a>. If you are unfamiliar with the Google APIs Console, please refer to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/console/help/#ApiConsole">documentation</a> which walks you through project setup.</p>
  <p>Once you have created a project in the Google APIs Console you will need to <a href="https://developers.google.com/console/help/#ApiConsole">associate Google Cloud Storage with that project</a>.</p>
  <p>Finally, download and install the gsutil application. <a href="/storage/docs/gsutil_install">Instructions</a> for installing gsutil are available. Ensure that gsutil is on your path, otherwise you will need to include the complete path to your installation when referencing gsutil in your scripts.</p>

  <a name="wbs"></a>
  <h2>Writing the Backup Script</h2>
  <p>In this next section, you will create a small python script that automates the task of backing up your data to Google Cloud Storage. You can use the following script as a template:</p>

  <h2>Creating a Cron Job</h2>
  <p>Now that you have a script that works for you, lets create a job! This tutorial creates a cron job using <a href="http://crontab.org/crontab.1.html">crontab</a>, however, you can use any scheduling tool that you are most comfortable with. Our goal is to create a job that runs your script at predetermined intervals. Use the cron job below as a guide.</p>
  <p>The following cron job can be created in Linux/Mac environments by issuing &ldquo;crontab -e&rdquo; on the command line. It is scheduled to run daily at 1:30AM system time:</p>

<pre>
30 1 * * * /path_to_dr_scripts/cassandra_dr_backup_script.py
</pre>

  <p>Be certain that the cron job is  configured to be run by a user that has access to the data and permission to start/stop services!</p>

  <a name="wrs"></a>
  <h2>Writing the Recovery Script</h2>
  <p>It makes more sense to use locally sourced recovery methods when you simply want to restore a few column families. But when those locally sourced recovery files are gone, as in the case where you are rebuilding from some real calamity, you will be happy that you saved your data and a copy of your recovery script in Google Cloud Storage. The recovery script is very similar to the backup script, except that you are copying in the opposite direction. Keep in mind that when restoring a multi-node cluster, it is important to bring the node(s) designated as &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; in cassandra.yaml online before your other nodes.</p>
  <p>A few steps to take during the restoration process after you&rsquo;ve installed Cassandra:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Download the restoration script for the host you want to recover</li>
    <li>Shutdown Cassandra (this step is incorporated in the sample script presented below)</li>
    <li>Run your script</li>
    <li>Update any configuration files not automatically restored by your script</li>
    <li>Restart Cassandra nodes in the proper order</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Use the following script as a guideline:</p>

  <h2>Further Considerations</h2>
  <p>This tutorial presented you with a high level overview and provided templates for backing up and recovering data. However it is worth mentioning a few more things that you should consider.</p>

  <h4>Best Practices</h4>
  <p>When working with large amounts of data, there may be instances where your files do not fully upload during the initial attempt. Even though gsutil will automatically retry up to six times before giving up, it is advisable to create another cron job that runs in 30 minute intervals checking for failed upload attempts and retrying them. Please review the <a href="/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/ScriptingProductionTransfers">documentation</a> found on the Google Developers site for more guidance and best practices for scripting production transfers with gsutil.</p>
  <h4>Durable Reduced Availability</h4>
  <p>You may wish to investigate whether <a href="/storage/docs/durable-reduced-availability">Durable Reduced Availability Storage</a> is a viable option for your backup needs. This offering enables you to store data at a lower cost, but with the tradeoff of lower availability than standard Google Cloud Storage.</p>

  <h4>Know Your Environment</h4>
  <p>The scripts used in this tutorial were written on a Linux system, with Cassandra installed as a service. Some of the commands will need to be changed to accommodate different OSes and Cassandra installations.</p>
