  <h3><a name="h.rce5f793j133" id="h.rce5f793j133"></a> A Cost-Effective Framework for Orchestrating the Google Cloud Platform through Auto Scaling</h3>

  <p>With Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine, and Cloud Datastore, Google offers a full suite of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) options that serve a variety of use cases. You can use these products in tandem to create large-scale applications that leverage the strength of the Google Cloud Platform for your business goals.</p>
  <p>In this paper, we explore a framework for a Google App Engine application that scales Google Compute Engine instances out or back as demand increases or decreases. We designed the framework to be extremely flexible, so that you can adjust it to meet your business needs.</p>
  <p>We wrote this paper primarily for Google Cloud Platform developers who are interested in an automatic approach to scaling Virtual Machine (VM)-based backends. You provide a configuration file, and the system automatically scales based on it. For the purpose of this discussion, we assume that you are familiar with App Engine and Compute Engine.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Any large-scale application needs to run on multiple servers or VM instances to handle user traffic. The question is how many such instances you need. One simple and common approach is to estimate peak load and provision for it, even if it is infrequent. The disadvantage of this approach is that many or most resources may lie idle for long periods. This approach makes the application much more expensive than it has to be, because idle but provisioned instances still cost money. Another disadvantage is that it is difficult or impossible to predict peak traffic, particularly for new applications. Mobile games are extremely variable in their uptake, for instance. Many have only a few users, while others have a high number. Resources must be provisioned appropriately for a good user experience.</p>
  <p>The second approach is to provision for average use, which wastes fewer resources. The pitfalls of this approach are (1) it can be challenging to predict average use, especially for new applications, and (2) above-average load usually results in a bad user experience, which could mean anything from increased latency to  user requests that are dropped entirely.</p>
  <p>Auto-scaling can solve these problems. It is particularly beneficial for applications whose usage is difficult or impossible to predict. When load increases, more resources are allocated to accommodate the need. The result is a good user experience, regardless of load. When resources are not needed, they are scaled back. This means good resource utilization and provisioning, which minimizes the cost of the application. It is difficult to provision resources with extremely high precision, but even a relatively simple auto-scaling process can lead to improved resource utilization without compromising the user experience.</p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>The framework we present here generally applies to any application that performs computation on Google Compute Engine instances and experiences variable usage. We focus on web or mobile applications that run their frontend on App Engine, but use Compute Engine for backend workloads that are self-managed. Such backend workloads may involve image processing, optical character recognition (OCR), video transcoding, or PDF generation, among other tasks. The following sample application fits this profile. It is a mobile application that lets users upload images and generate transformed images on demand. This application benefits from auto-scaling to accommodate variable load, because predicting the user load at any given time is difficult. Again, you can readily apply the orchestration framework to any application that handles varying user loads and uses Compute Engine to perform backend processing.</p>

  <h2>Solution overview</h2>
  <p>The orchestration framework involves a tool implemented as an App Engine application. This tool periodically queries all running Compute Engine instances for their status. Depending on the application, the status may be CPU load and memory usage or the number of pending tasks. Based on user-specified criteria, the orchestrator spins up new instances if load is high and initiates the shutdown of instances when load is low.</p>
  <p>In our scenario, the orchestrator acts as a stand-alone App Engine application. It could also be included as part of an existing app&mdash;by App Engine Modules, for example. Each Compute Engine instance runs a local agent that exposes an endpoint for querying current CPU and memory load, which the orchestrator periodically retrieves from all instances. We call this local agent &ldquo;status publisher.&rdquo; It makes the current CPU and memory load accessible to the orchestrator, which periodically retrieves this information from all instances.</p>
  <p>Our &ldquo;orchestrated&rdquo; application is the actual business application that the orchestrator watches and manages by scaling VM instances out and back. As described above, such an orchestrated application can be anything with Compute Engine backends and variable usage. In our example, it is an application for uploading, processing, and generating new, transformed images. It is implemented as a mobile and App Engine application that communicates with Compute Engine VMs via pull queues. The App Engine application enqueues tasks for processing and image generation, while the Compute Engine backends lease those tasks.</p>

  <h3><a name="h.3oehktenp6vt" id="h.3oehktenp6vt"></a>Diagram walkthrough</h3>
  <p>The orchestrator monitors the state of VM instances running business logic as part of an orchestrated application (&ldquo;Application&rdquo; in the diagram). Our sample application runs its frontends on App Engine and backend processing on Compute Engine. The App Engine application, (&ldquo;A&rdquo;) enqueues tasks to be performed by the backends, and the Compute Engine instances (&ldquo;B&rdquo;) lease these tasks.</p>
  <p>The process begins with the orchestrator reading an XML configuration file upon startup. Similar to an appengine-web.xml file, this file specifies the heuristics for scaling the GCE instances out or back. The file might include, for example, a maximum average CPU load for the GCE instances as a trigger to create more instances. The triggers currently supported in our implementation are described below.</p>
  <p>The App Engine orchestration app acts as the orchestrator for auto-scaling the Compute Engine instances. Generally and most simply, a cron job invokes the orchestrator. In our solution, the orchestrator runs as a resident App Engine backend, which has the advantage that only one instance is available reliably.</p>
  <p>The orchestrator uses the Compute Engine REST API to retrieve IPs for all running instances for the project (&ldquo;1&rdquo; in our diagram). For each GCE instance on that authoritative list, the orchestrator sends a request to each GCE instance for information about the load status (&ldquo;2&rdquo;). In our example, the GCE instances receive requests at http://[ip_address]:[port]/StatusPublisher/status. The port is determined by the web server running on the instance and is configurable. </p>
  <p>The status contains any information that the orchestrator may use to determine whether to scale out, back, or do nothing. The information can be CPU load, memory, number of currently leased tasks, and so on. In our example, we publish system information about system load, memory usage, and information about currently leased tasks. The orchestrator makes a decision (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) based on the information provided.</p>

  <h3>Scaling out or back</h3>
  <p>Now, we look at possible decision outcomes. Every time the orchestrator runs&mdash;that is, when it is invoked by the cron job&mdash;it accumulates information from all the currently active instances. It makes a scaling decision using the configuration provided by the application administrator in the configuration file. If the configuration file specifies creation of a new instance when the average CPU load is greater than 0.5, for instance, the orchestrator computes that average CPU load and creates a new instance when the average exceeds 0.5. Orchestration has three possible outcomes:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">Do nothing</span><br>
        If no actions are required based on the current configuration, do nothing. If the orchestrator performs a check frequently, such as once every minute, this is the most frequent outcome.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">Create more instances (scale out)</span><br>
        App Engine does this via the Compute Engine API. By default, only one new instance is created, although this value is configurable. The instance is created from a snapshot that replicates existing instances. A startup script also runs, so that the status publishing web server is set up and started properly on the new instance. This script lets the orchestrator query the new instance for its status.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">Scale back</span><br>
        If the load is extremely low, instances should be shut down&mdash;one by default, or more if configured. Instances cannot be shut down immediately if they are in the middle of performing one or more tasks. The orchestrator sends a &ldquo;prepare to be shut down&rdquo; request to one of the Compute Engine backends. The backend reacts by not leasing any new tasks from the pull queue. It publishes a new status, &ldquo;ready to be shut down,&rdquo; when it finishes with the current task load. In response to the &ldquo;ready to be shut down&rdquo; status, the orchestrator deletes the instance. Which Compute Engine backend to shut down is a tricky question. In the simplest case, all tasks on the pull queue take the same of time. The orchestrator then computes the estimated time to completion for each instance, and chooses to shut down the one that is scheduled to finish first. In many real-world applications, of course, this is not possible. In general, if possible, the orchestrator should request to shut down the instance that will finish first. For billing reasons, it never makes sense to terminate an instance that has been running for less than 10 minutes.
      </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Heuristics for Scaling</h3>
  <p>Which heuristics you should use for scaling depend on the specifics of the orchestrated application. We discuss a few cases below. For this discussion, we assume that VMs lease tasks in a predictable fashion, with a fixed number of tasks at fixed intervals. If this is not the case, orchestration is harder to accomplish and is likely based on simpler heuristics, such as CPU utilization only. The effectiveness of this strategy depends on the use case.</p>
  <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">Applications with very predictable and homogenous tasks</span><br>
        Some applications perform similar tasks repeatedly, such as a specific image-processing task. In such cases, each task or set of tasks leased by a Compute Engine VM is predictable in terms of expected completion time, CPU and memory usage, and I/O. This is by far the easiest kind of application to orchestrate, because the only variables that change over time are the user load and the number of  tasks. You need to know whether the tasks are high in memory usage, CPU usage, or I/O, and base the scaling heuristics only on what the processing bottleneck is. (Read more about I/O-intensive tasks below.) Another advantage of this scenario is that it is easy to choose the VM or VMs to shut down after a scale-down decision has been made. Specifically, if the interval at which VMs lease tasks is fixed, shutting down the VM or VMs that are closest to completing their already-leased tasks makes the most sense. This scenario is most convenient for autoscaling orchestration, but many real-world applications unfortunately do not fit perfectly into this category.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">Applications with unpredictable tasks or heterogeneous tasks</span><br>
        Many applications fall into a category in which tasks vary in terms of I/O intensity, CPU intensity, and so on. There can be different categories of tasks, or tasks whose memory/CPU consumption varies based on outside factors. A video transcoding app, for instance, takes different resources and time, depending on the length of the video. Again, the scaling heuristics in this case should be based on the largest observed bottleneck, such as CPU consumption. Another effective strategy is to distribute the tasks so that loads become homogenous by having dedicated backends for specific kinds of tasks. For instance, OCR happens on one set of backends, while PDF report generation happens on another set. Distribution makes load more predictable on all instances. Distribution can be accomplished by having multiple pull queues and by extending the orchestrator to be make pull-queue specific decisions. If this approach is not possible, it may make sense to scale out aggressively and scale back conservatively. In other words, if CPU load or memory load or the number of leased tasks exceeds certain thresholds, the application scales out to optimize the user experience. Scaling back is done under stricter conditions, so that the user experience is not at risk if enough VMs are not available. Scaling back likely leads to more over-provisioning, but this strategy emphasizes user experience over resource optimization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">I/O intensive applications</span><br>
        Such an application spends most of its processing time for tasks on I/O, which is not necessarily reflected in high CPU utilization. Depending on the application, tasks high in I/O lead to high memory consumption, such as reading from disk into memory. In these cases, orchestration should be based on memory consumption. In other cases, it may be possible to predict the time to completion for each task, for example when the tasks are homogeneous, or the completion time can be computed or estimated from the number of records in a database. If completion time can be estimated, orchestration should be based on tasks waiting to be executed. This is accomplished by the orchestrator as well as each VM-local agent tracking the number of tasks enqueued/leased.
      </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Implementation details</h2>
  <p>Our implementation currently supports a small set of conditions. The orchestrator implementation is open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-google-compute-engine-orchestrator" target="github">here</a>, however. We expect that application developers, administrators, and other users will extend this implementation if necessary to serve their particular needs.</p>
  <p>The following are supported:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">maximum-ave-cpu-load</span>: An integer between 0 and 100 representing a percentage.<br>
        When the average CPU load of all running instances exceeds this threshold, one or more new instances, as configured by <span class="ital">num-instances-to-create</span>, are created. Setting this property to 100 means no instances are ever created. Similarly, 0 is not a valid value. Setting the property to 0 means that every time the orchestrator is run, which can be as often as once a minute, a new instance is created.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">minimum-ave-cpu-load</span>:  An integer between 0 and 100 representing a percentage.<br>
        If the minimum average CPU load is lower than this value, the orchestrator determines one or more backend instances, as configured by <span class="ital">num-instances-to-shut-down</span>, to be shut down and issue a request for them to get ready to be shut down.
      </li>
      <li><span class="ital">maximum-ave-memory-usage</span>: Similar to <span class="ital">maximum-ave-cpu-load</span>, but for memory usage.</li>
      <li><span class="ital">minimum-ave-memory-usage</span>: Similar to <span class="ital">minimum-ave-cpu-load</span>, but for memory usage.</li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">maximum-number-leased-tasks</span>: An integer greater than 1.<br>
        In some use cases, it is possible to predict how resource-intensive a task is. Scaling decisions can be based on the number of tasks that are currently leased. If the <span class="ital">maximum-number-leased-tasks</span> exceeds the value set by the user, a new instance is created.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">minimum-number-leased-tasks</span>: Similar to <span class="ital">maximum-number-leased-tasks</span>, this allows the orchestrator to shut down one or more instances when the number of leased tasks is below this threshold.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">num-instances-to-create</span>: An integer greater than 1. By default, only one instance is created.<br>
        By setting this value to a number greater than 1, more than one instance can be spun up when a scaling-out decision is made. This will allow very bursty applications to scale out very quickly when necessary.
      </li>
      <li><span class="ital">num-instances-to-shut-down</span>: Similar to <span class="ital">num-instances-to-create</span>, but for shutting down instances.</li>
      <li>
        <span class="ital">num-idle-instances</span>: Number of idle instances.<br>
        The number of instances that can be running but idle. Idle instances keep the application performing well in cases where usage spikes extremely quickly, because these instances can be put to immediate use without having to be spun up. When load drops, this number indicates how many instances can stay running without being shut down even though they are idle.
      </li>
  </ul>


  <p>While these values are readily configurable, take care to avoid certain pitfalls. Having the <span class="ital">minimum-ave-cpu-load</span> and <span class="ital">maximum-ave-cpu-load</span> be very close in value, for instance, can lead to a situation in which instances are constantly spun up and shut down. This situation is unnecessarily expensive and can negatively affect the user experience. Remember, scaling decisions are best based on the application&rsquo;s bottleneck, whether that is CPU, memory, or another criterion.</p>
  <p>The configuration determines how to provision instances. In some cases, there are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. To respond to sudden spikes in usage you may set the <span class="ital">maximum-ave-cpu-load</span> to be low, forcing new instances to be spun up under relatively low load. Or you may set the <span class="ital">num-idle-instances</span> value.</p>
  <p>The above values are specified in the configuration file along with other configuration information necessary for orchestration to work. Configuration must include the following features:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>A snapshot used to create new instances. Starting a new Compute Engine instance from a snapshot ensures that the new instances can run the same application logic as the ones already running. Snapshots come with the status publisher web app installed, so that they can respond to requests from the  orchestrator.</li>
      <li>A startup script that initializes and starts any necessary application logic as well as the web server to publish status.</li>
      <li>Additional configuration, such as what machine type to use and any necessary authentication information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Framework implementation and sample app</h2>
  <p>A starter implementation for the orchestration framework is available for download <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-google-compute-engine-orchestrator" target="github">here</a>. This framework consists of the orchestrator and the status publisher. The orchestrator is a Google App Engine application. It can be run either in a stand-alone fashion or as part of an existing App Engine application. Users of this code are encouraged to configure it and/or extend the code to meet their specific business needs. The status publisher is run on each Compute Engine instance together with the application. For orchestration to work properly, the status publisher has to start whenever a new instance is spun up. You can do this with the included startup script, which can be made part of a larger startup script used by the orchestrated application.</p>
  <p>As we mentioned, auto scaling can be applied to a wide variety of use cases. The main criterion for a good use case is whether an application uses multiple Compute Engine instances and has variable workload, which includes cases in which usage changes rapidly. One such application is a mobile application for image upload and processing, which we provide as a sample application <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-orchestrator-android-sampleapp-smashpix" target="github">here</a>. In this scenario, end users take pictures they want transformed and upload them to Google Cloud Storage. An application running on Compute Engine performs image processing to reduce the number of colors and pixelate the image. Users can then browse to see the transformed images uploaded by all users through the service. This application is a good fit for the orchestration framework because usage is unpredictable, especially as the user base grows. The orchestrator framework can help ensure that the user experience does not suffer during any usage bursts, by bringing up new instances as needed. The cost of the application is kept at a minimum by shutting down instances when they are no longer needed.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>We have described a framework for auto-scaling Google Compute Engine instances by using an orchestrator application that runs on Google App Engine. We believe that the framework is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of use cases. But it is best suited for situations in which the Compute Engine backends perform resource-intensive tasks in support of App Engine frontends.</p>
  <p>The source code for the framework is available for download as described above. We hope you use the provided starter implementation and fit it to your needs, so you can accommodate variable traffic while providing an optimal user experience even under heavy load.</p>
