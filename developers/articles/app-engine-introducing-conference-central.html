  <p>Welcome to the lab exercises for the Google Cloud Platform Partner Qualification Training. As you work through the lab exercises for the training you will build and extend a sample application called Conference Central.</p>
  <p>The Conference Central application allows users to schedule conferences and register for conferences. To help you understand what you will be building, this first exercise walks you through a partially completed version of the application.</p>
  <p>In this exercise, you will deploy the application to App Engine, take a look at what the application does, and then use the App Engine Admin Console to investigate some ways to optimize performance.</p>

  <h2><a name="h.qf8ny24ukrk9" id="h.qf8ny24ukrk9"></a>What You Will Learn</h2>
  <p>You will learn how to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Import a zip file with an App Engine application</li>
    <li>Deploy an application to App Engine</li>
    <li>Change the pending latency of the application</li>
    <li>Use the ab (Apache Bench) command in a console window to send requests to the application to see the results of changing the minimum pending latency.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="h.67bvs6r0ddmb" id="h.67bvs6r0ddmb"></a>What You Will Do</h2>
  <p>In this exercise, you will:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download a zip containing the Conference Central application.</li>
    <li>Deploy the application to App Engine.</li>
    <li>Visit the different pages in the application to create a user profile, create some conferences, and register for a conference or two.</li>
    <li>In the Admin Console for the deployed application, change the minimum pending latency.</li>
    <li>Use the ab (Apache Bench) command in a console window to submit requests to the application, and then view the latency for the instances that spin up to handle the increase in requests.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="h.5yz0s0t2lmd7" id="h.5yz0s0t2lmd7"></a>Get Ready</h2>
  <p><span class="bld">1.</span> Install the latest App Engine SDK 1.8.n  (if not already installed).</p>
  <p>The zips you will be downloading as you work through the exercises may have been created with an earlier version of the App Engine. However, we recommend you work with the latest version of the SDK.</p>
  <ul>

  </ol>

  <p><span class="bld">3.</span> For Java, if your project shows errors in Eclipse, update it to use the latest SDK.</p>
  <ol>
      <li>In Eclipse, select the applicable project.</li>
      <li>Choose File &gt; Properties &gt; Google &gt; App Engine.</li>
      <li>Select <span class="bld">Use specific SDK</span>, and choose the latest version.</li>
      <li>It's best to have your project use the default SDK, so again Choose File &gt; Properties &gt; Google &gt; App Engine.</li>
      <li>This time choose <span class="bld">Use default SDK</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="h.on8xjt2nr0ks" id="h.on8xjt2nr0ks"></a>Set the Application ID</h2>
  <p>Every application must have an &ldquo;application ID,&rdquo; which corresponds to one of the IDs that you have created on <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">https://appengine.google.com/</a>. Every developer can have up to ten application IDs when operating in the free tier. During development and testing, it&rsquo;s a good idea to recycle application IDs whenever possible so that you don&rsquo;t use up all your free application IDs.</p>

  <p><span class="bld">1.</span> Get an Application ID to use for the Conference Central application.</p>
  <p>Go to <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">https://appengine.google.com/</a> and review your existing application IDs. Either pick an existing one or create a new one to use for the Conference Central application.</p>
  <p>If you create a new application:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Set the application&rsquo;s type to <span class="bld">App Engine</span> (to be hosted on <span class="bld">appspot.com</span>).</li>
      <li>In the second screen, set the <span class="bld">Application Title</span> to Conference Central.</li>
      <li>Be sure to leave the Authentication Options as <span class="bld">Open to all Google Accounts users (default)</span>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><span class="bld">2.</span> Update the sample conference application to use your Application ID.</p>

  <h4>Java:</h4>
  <ol>
      <li>In the war &gt; WEB-INF folder, edit appengine-web.xml.</li>
      <li>
        Update the value of the &lt;application&gt; tag to be your own App Engine application ID:<br>&lt;application&gt;<span class="bld">yourappid</span>&lt;/application&gt;
        <p><span class="bld">Note:</span> If you re-use an existing App Engine application, you can find the full name of your application in the App Engine console under <span class="bld">Application Settings &gt; Application Identifier</span>.</p>
      </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Python:</h4>
  <ol>
      <li>Edit app.yaml.</li>
      <li>Change the value of the application element to be your own App Engine ID:
        <br><span class="code">application: <span class="bld">yourappid</span></span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="h.5hza0yf6c2a1" id="h.5hza0yf6c2a1"></a>Explore the Application on LocalHost</h2>
  <p>The next step is to deploy and run the application on your local development server.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">1.</span> Run the Conference Central application on the development server for App Engine running on localhost on your local machine.</p>
  <p>For detailed instructions on how to deploy, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/13HwK6Pb1hrWIBcdV63XISlIngNLKRf9ErcjOaZqbPvM/edit#heading=h.jt1dqmgl2uq9">Deploying an App Engine Application</a>.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">2.</span> Go to the Conference Central in a browser.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">Java:</span> Go to <a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a></p>
  <p><span class="bld">Python:</span> Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:</a><a href="http://localhost:8080/">8080</a><a href="http://localhost:8080/">/</a> (<span class="bld">Note:</span> The port number may be different for each user)</p>
  <p>The Conference Central application opens at the home page.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/articles/app-engine-introducing-conference-central/conf-central.png">
  </figure>

  <p><span class="bld">3.</span> Create a User Profile in the <span class="bld">User Profile</span> page of the Conference Central application. (Click &ldquo;Go to your user profile&rdquo;.)</p>
  <p>Go ahead and login if asked. Be sure to login in as an Administrator. (Click the checkbox.)</p>
  <p>Register your interest in one or more topics. (Select one or more topics from the list.)</p>
  <p><span class="bld">4.</span> Create a conference on the <span class="bld">Create Conference</span> page.  <span class="bld">Note:</span> Keep the maxAttendees to 100 or less to minimize usage of your datastore quota.</p>
  <p>Notice that the new conference is announced at the top of the page.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">5.</span> Create three more conferences. Be sure that some take place in London, and some are about Medical Innovations. <span class="bld">Note:</span> Keep the maxAttendees to 100 or less so you don&rsquo;t use up datastore quota.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">6.</span> Go to the <span class="bld">Upcoming Conferences</span> Page.</p>
  <p>Scroll through the page -- you see various tables showing the conferences filtered by different criteria. Obviously in a production application, you wouldn&rsquo;t have a page that displays multiple tables like this, but the purpose of this page is to display the results of queries that use different kinds of filters.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">7.</span> Buy a ticket for one of the conferences.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">8.</span> Review the User Profile page.</p>
  <p>The User Profile page should now show the conferences that you have bought tickets for.</p>

  <h2><a name="h.8xc6n5jo8dej" id="h.8xc6n5jo8dej"></a>Explore the Application on App Engine</h2>
  <p>So far, you have tested the Conference Central application on the local development server. The development server provides a good simulation of how the application behaves on App Engine, but it has some limitations. For example, the local server does not run cron jobs or send emails.</p>
  <p>The next step is to deploy it to App Engine in production.</p>
  <p>First, you need to make a small change to the code for the application so that the application uses an appropriate email address for sending email.</p>
  <p class="indnt"><span class="bld">Note:</span> An application can only send email on behalf of registered developers of the application.</p>
  <h3><a name="h.vl8v9l1oqeo6" id="h.vl8v9l1oqeo6"></a>Update the Sender Email Address for your Application</h3>
  <p>In your development environment, make the following changes:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><span class="bld">Java:</span> Edit NotifyInterestedUsers.java and set the value of fromEmail to your own email address.</li>
      <li><span class="bld">Python:</span> In main.py, in the _SendMail function, change:<br>
          <br>registered_admin@yourapp.appspot.com<br>
          <br>to be your email address.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="bld">Note:</span> The email address must be one that is associated with the App Engine application. You can see the emails for the App Engine application in the Permissions page in the App Engine console (at <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">appengine.google.com</a>)</p>

  <h3><a name="h.psqtei98dwnh" id="h.psqtei98dwnh"></a>Deploy to App Engine</h3>
  <p><span class="bld">1.</span> Deploy the Conference Central application App Engine.</p>
  <p>For detailed instructions on how to deploy, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/13HwK6Pb1hrWIBcdV63XISlIngNLKRf9ErcjOaZqbPvM/edit#heading=h.jt1dqmgl2uq9">Deploying an App Engine Application</a>.</p>
  <p>Note: for Python launcher, you will need an application specific password, you can get it at:</p>
  <p><a href="https://accounts.google.com/b/0/IssuedAuthSubTokens#accesscodes">https://accounts.google.com/b/0/IssuedAuthSubTokens#accesscodes</a></p>
  <p><span class="bld">2.</span> Go to the Conference Central application on App Engine.</p>
  <p>To get to your Conference Central, either:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href="http://appengine.google.com">appengine.google.com</a> and click &ldquo;Running&rdquo; (on the right) for the appropropriate App Engine ID.<br>
          OR</li>
      <li>Go to <span class="bld">http:&lt;yourappengineid&gt;.appspot.com.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p><span class="bld">Note:</span> If you re-used an existing App ID, you will need to make sure you are running the correct version of the application. Go to the <a href="http://appengine.google.com">Admin Console</a> for your application, select Versions in the left hand nav panel, and select the new version to be the default version.</p>

  <h3><a name="h.ru8elrjere52" id="h.ru8elrjere52"></a>Make Sure the Indexes are Serving</h3>
  <p>When an application is deployed or updated on App Engine, the system must build the indexes needed for queries.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">1.</span> In another tab in your browser, go to the Admin Console for your Conference Central application on App Engine.</p>
  <p>Go to <a href="http://appengine.google.com">appengine.google.com</a> and select the applicable App Engine ID.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">2.</span> In the Data section (on the left), click Datastore Indexes.</p>
  <p>The Datastore Indexes page shows the indexes. When you deploy or update an application, it can take a few minutes for the indexes to finish building.</p>
  <p>In the  following screenshot, the indexes for querying Conferences have finished building while the indexes for Tickets are still building. Depending on where things stand with your own application, you may see that all your indexes are still building, or all are now serving, or some combination.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/articles/app-engine-introducing-conference-central/conference.png">
  </figure>

  <h3><a name="h.xb3k3lv3kiuv" id="h.xb3k3lv3kiuv"></a>Create a Conference to Send Email to Interested Users</h3>
  <p><span class="bld">1.</span> Go to the tab showing the Conference Central application in your browser.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">2.</span> Create a User Profile, and register your interest in one or more topics. Make sure the email for receiving notifications is a valid email account where you can receive emails.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">3.</span> Create a conference for a topic that you have registered to be notified about in your User Profile.</p>
  <p>If you get an error, read it. Does it say that the indexes are still building? If you get this error, the conference will have been created, but the query that gets the tickets could not complete because the index is not ready. (You will learn about indexes later). However, the conference has been created and you can proceed to the next step.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">4.</span> Check the email account (that you entered in the User Profile form).</p>
  <p>You should have received an email notifying you about the new conference. (The emails are sent by task queues, it might take a few minutes before they are sent, it is not instantaneous).</p>
  <p>Note that the development server does not send emails, so if you are testing the Conference Central application on the development server, you will not get emails from it.</p>

  <h3><a name="h.y7eweblsq9mo" id="h.y7eweblsq9mo"></a>Review Newly Created Conferences</h3>
  <p><span class="bld">1.</span> In the Conference Central application running on App Engine (not localhost), create several conferences.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">Note:</span> These steps use pull queues behind the scenes, and there are sometimes issues with pull queues on localhost, so be sure to run the application running on App Engine. You will learn about pull queues in Exercise 6.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">2.</span> Go to the Developer Page, and click the link to review conferences.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">Note:</span> The link to the Developers Page is only visible if you are logged in as an administrator, or developer, of the application. If you do not see the link to the Developers Page, it means you are logged in with an email that is not the same as the email you used to create the application, so you will need to logout and login again with an appropriate email.</p>
  <p>This screenshot shows the top of the Developer Page, (the page has more content below, but for now we are only interested in the link to Review Conferences).</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/articles/app-engine-introducing-conference-central/dev-page.png">
  </figure>

  <p><span class="bld">3.</span> Click the <span class="bld">Review Conferences</span> button. This will take you to a new page, Review Conferences.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">4.</span> Click the <span class="bld">Review New Conferences</span> button. (For Python, you might see the table immediately without having to click the button).</p>
  <p>You should see a table showing the newly added conferences. Feel free to review and approve the conferences -- after all, you scheduled them.</p>
  <p>The list of conferences to be reviewed might not behave as you expect (for example, if you approve one conference, the other conferences might disappear for a while but then reappear). Don&rsquo;t worry about that for now. The purpose of the Review New Conferences page is to illustrate the use of pull queues -- you will learn about queues in exercise 6.</p>

  <h2><a name="h.qtkanxwowwcz" id="h.qtkanxwowwcz"></a>Investigate Factors that Control Application Performance</h2>
  <p>So far you have learned the basic operation of the Conference Central application. Next, you can start investigating some of the factors for controlling performance. You will first configure your application for high latency, then for low latency, and compare the number of frontend instances that are activated in each case.</p>

  <h3><a name="h.bvj5v6y4bhko" id="h.bvj5v6y4bhko"></a>Configure the Application for High Latency</h3>
  <p>In this step, you will configure the application for high latency, and then you will conduct a load test to see how the number of application instances changes.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open the Admin Console for the application.</li>
    <li>In the left navigation menu, in the Main section,  click the Instances link.<br>
        This displays the instances page. You will probably have one instance running (but you might have none or more than one).<br>
        <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/articles/app-engine-introducing-conference-central/ae-release.png">
        </figure>
    </li>
    <li>In the  Administration section of the navigation list on the left, select Application Settings.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the Performance section.</li>
    <li>Set the Min Pending Latency to 15 s by moving the slider all the way to the right as shown here.<br>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/articles/app-engine-introducing-conference-central/pending-latency.png">
        </figure>
        <br>
        This means that the App Engine will start creating new application instances when the majority of the requests are spending more than 15 seconds on the pending queue waiting to be processed.</li>
    <li>Save Settings. (Make sure you click Save for the section you are in; each section has its own Save button).</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Run a benchmark to test the performance of your application</h3>
  <p>You will use the ab (Apache Bench) command to issue 50 requests from 100 concurrent users.</p>
  <p><span class="bld">IMPORTANT:</span> We recommend that you issue the requests to the home page because it does not create entities or query the datastore. If you run the ab command on the List Conferences page (or some of the other pages) you could end up burning up all your daily quota right away!</p>
  <p>On Mac and Windows, the ab command is likely installed already.</p>
  <p>On Ubuntu, you can install Apache tools (which includes Apache Bench) as follows:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
</pre>

  <ol>
    <li>Open a Terminal (console) window.</li>
    <li>Execute the following command.<br>
        <br>ab -n 50 -c 100 -t 60 http://<span class="bld">your_app_id</span>.appspot.com/<br>
        <br>The &ldquo;ab&rdquo; (Apache Bench) command will issue 50 HTTP requests to the application from 100 concurrent users for a minute.<br>
        <br><span class="bld">Note:</span> If the command returns quickly with error messages, try a few times.<br>
        <br>
        When it is running, you should get a message similar to this:<br>
        <br>This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 &lt;$Revision: 655654 $&gt;<br>
        Copyright 1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd, http://www.zeustech.net/<br>
        Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation, http://www.apache.org/<br>
        Benchmarking &lt;your app id&gt;.appspot.com (be patient)<br></li>
    <li>While the command is benchmarking, go back to the Admin Console and click the Instances link. Confirm that two or three instances have been created.</li>
    <li>For each instance, check the numbers in the Latency and Requests columns as shown in the following figure.<br>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/articles/app-engine-introducing-conference-central/total-num.png">
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li>Reload the Instances page a few times to see that the number of instances is not growing rapidly.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="h.47r51vu0e6ul" id="h.47r51vu0e6ul"></a>Configure the Application for Low Latency</h3>
  <p>Now you will change the Pending Latency to a lower number, conduct the load test again, and see how the results compare to when the application was configured for high latency.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the Terminal, click the Ctrl+c key to stop the ab command if necessary.</li>
    <li>In the Instances page in the Admin Console, click  the Shutdown button on each instance. Repeat this step until there are no instance runnings.</li>
    <li>Go back to the Application Settings page and set the Min Pending Latency to roughly <span class="bld">30 ms</span> by moving the slider all the way to the left and then back to the right a little.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This means that the App Engine will start creating new application instances when the majority of the requests are spending about 10 to 50 milliseconds on the pending queue waiting to be processed.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Save Settings.</li>
    <li>Execute the same &ldquo;ab&rdquo; command as before.<br>
        <br>ab -n 50 -c 100 -t 60 &lt;<span class="bld">your_app_id</span>.appspot.com&gt;<br></li>
    <li>Go to the Instances page and confirm that there are several instances running.</li>
    <li>Reload the page a few times to see that the number of instances is growing rapidly.<br>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/articles/app-engine-introducing-conference-central/instances.png">
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li>In the Terminal, hit Ctrl+c key to stop the ab command if necessary.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="h.pg74qcn20o4x" id="h.pg74qcn20o4x"></a>Check Daily Quotas</h2>
  <p>Running the Apache Bench command is a convenient way to simulate sending many requests to your application, but you need to be careful about using up your daily quota. Now is a good time to check your daily quota.</p>
  <ol>
      <li>In the Admin Console for your application, in the Main section on the left, click the link to go to the Quota Details page.</li>
      <li>How many requests has your application received?</li>
      <li>How many Frontend Instance Hours have been used?</li>
      <li>Are any of your quotas close to being used up?</li>
      <li>When is the next reset for your daily quotas?</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Some of the quota has been used by the Apache Bench commands. However, when you tried out your application by creating a User Profile and creating and registering for conferences, you used up some of your datastore quota.</p>

  <h2><a name="h.xwzbdl5bwemw" id="h.xwzbdl5bwemw"></a>Clean Up</h2>
  <p>To get ready to build the Conference Central application from scratch, you need to delete all existing Announcements, Registered Users, Conferences, and Tickets. You also need to flush memcache to remove all memcache entries.</p>

  <h3><a name="h.pv3m13byozjo" id="h.pv3m13byozjo"></a>Delete All Entities</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>In the Admin Console, in the Data section, select Datastore Admin.</li>
      <li>Enable the Datastore Admin if necessary.<br>

      </li>
      <li>Select Entity Kind to select all entities.</li>
      <li>Press Delete Entites to delete all the entities.<br>

      </li>
      <li>Confirm Deletion of the entities.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="h.23wutckzfhp5" id="h.23wutckzfhp5"></a>Flush Memcache</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>In the Data section, select Memcache Viewer.<br></li>
      <li>Select <span class="bld">Flush Memcache</span>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note: You might need to refresh the browser to see that all the entities in memcache are gone.</p>

  <h2><a name="h.gjl88vd7j2qv" id="h.gjl88vd7j2qv"></a>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In this exercise, you deployed the Conference Central application and tried it out, to learn what you will be building as you work through the exercises.</p>
  <p>You configured the pending latency in the <a href="http://appengine.google.com">Administration Console</a>. When the pending latency is high, requests stay longer in the queue waiting to be served before App Engine activates more front end instances to handle the load. When pending latency is low, requests are served more quickly, but more frontend instances are spun up to handle demand, using up your frontend instance quota, and resulting in higher costs (when billing is enabled). If billing is not enabled, your application will stop serving requests when the daily quota is used up.</p>
  <p>You also learned how to use the Datastore Admin page in the Admin Console to delete all entities of a kind (you will learn about entities soon). Be very careful doing this on a production application!</p>
  <p>In the next exercise, you will start from scratch (almost), building the Conference Central application for yourself.</p>
